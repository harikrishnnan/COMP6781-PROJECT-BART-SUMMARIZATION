## Libraries Required
Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the required Python libraries.

## Files 
`BART-Data Preparation for fine tuning.ipynb` - Used as a data preparation code that will be used for fine-tuning BART. 
                                                Run all the cells and modify the data location before running it.

`BART-Fine-Tunining.ipynb` - This notebook uses the data prepared from the previous file to fine-tune the model. the first cell load the pickle file generated by the previous file. Feel free to modify the epochs value.

`BARTSumPipeline.ipynb` - The main notebook that uses the base `BART-large-CNN` model and its fine-tuned version to produce summaries using the ranked approach and section summary approach. modify the dataset path as necessary. Run all cells, you can slice the test set to summarize a specific number of documents

`Compute Scores.ipynb` - Is used to compute the avg,min, max of each metrics for each dataset. It uses the scores stored in the pickle file by the previous file.
